```

### Info how to make best use of the workflow ⏯
- Clone the repo
- Create the env using the above commands 
- Install the package 
- All the tests goes into the `tests` directory 
- Any test experiments eg- `Data wraggling/inital exploration notebooks` goes under `experiments` directory
- All modelling and related details into `analysis_framework`, create subdirectories as required 
- Under forecasting_framework there are three submodules `utils`, `model`, `data` 
  - `utils` reusable code components
  - `model` all modelling aspects (**python scripts only**)
  - `data` pipepine and raw data

### About pre-commit-hooks and activating 🔌
Just like the name suggests, precommit-hooks are designed to format the code based on PEP standards before committing. [More details 🗒](https://pre-commit.com/)
```python
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install

"""---commit your changes---
- check for errors, hooks format the code by deafult
- add the files
- commit it again
- push the changes 
"""
```

### Data pipeline 🛠

- Built using `Dagster`, an open source orchestration tool 

**Commands to trigger the pipeline**
- Command to run the pipeline from root `capstone_isb`
```shell
python analysis_framework/pipeline/process.py
```
